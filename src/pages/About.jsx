      <h2>About TeenConnect</h2>
      <p>TeenConnect is a safe, anonymous platform that connects teens with trained volunteer mentors for private, supportive chats. Our goal is to provide a low-pressure space where young people can share their feelings and get practical advice.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Teens post short, private reports about their concerns.</li>
        <li>Mentors can accept cases and provide supportive, non-judgmental guidance.</li>
        <li>The platform includes moderation and safety tools to protect privacy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>For questions or support, contact <a href="mailto:support@teenconnect.example">support@teenconnect.example</a>.</p>
